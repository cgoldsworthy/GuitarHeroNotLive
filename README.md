# GuitarHeroNotLive
An old Guitar Hero clone project my friends and I made in High School junior year for our final project in
Advanced Computer Science (different from APCS). Music has not been uploaded.


The game would work by reading in a text file full of "notes" into a queue. Each note had a delay on it and the queue would poll after the delay
was reached from the last time the queue was polled. Each time the queue polled a note of whichever type of the 5 notes was polled would 
appear at the top of the track on screen and fall towards the bar. The player was supposed to press the key of the note (1-5 right to left) 
when it hit the bar of circles near the bottom of the screen. If you did it in time, the note would disappear and you'd recieve points based on
how many notes you hit in a row. Miss too many notes and you'd fail the song and the game would close (we were novice programmers and game
designers on a semi-tight time constraint for this project).

The GTH files are from a separate program a friend of mine made to make song charting easier. They're just text files with a unique extension.
